He has been vegan for a decade and an activist for the last nine years.\u00a0\u00a0","1":"The following lessons are based on his experience working for vegan charities, organising and running street outreach, and\u00a0Viva!\u2019s\u00a0report\u00a0Envirocidal, which compiles the most up-to-date information from leading experts and researchers.\u00a0\u00a0","2":"We\u2019re currently in the sixth mass extinction with potentially one million species facing extinction within decades. A great deal of the devastation has been caused by human activity, from greenhouse gas emissions to the intensification of land and exploitation of earth\u2019s resources. Animal agriculture has been shown to be a leading cause of several of the planet\u2019s most\u00a0severe crises. The science is clear, we must transition away from animal agriculture to mitigate the worst effects of the climate emergency.\u00a0\u00a0","3":"Despite report after report, there is still a lot of confusion around animal agriculture and its impact on the planet, and it\u2019s no good saying any of the above if we don\u2019t have the knowledge and confidence to explain how. In this course I will discuss some of the main ways in which animal agriculture is responsible for such devastation on the planet, other animals and indeed humankind\u2019s own chances of survival. I will address some of the most common questions and suggest ways in which we can answer those questions whether during talks, using social media or doing outreach.\u00a0\u00a0","4":"Before going into the FAQs, have a watch of this quick two minute video overviewing how animal products impact on our world\u00a0here.\u00a0","5":"We\u2019ve heard a lot of these FAQs time and time again, and it can be easy to dismiss concerns and shake our heads with fellow vegans, despairing at such questions. But that\u2019s not helpful for the person genuinely asking the question, nor for the planet\u00a0we\u2019re\u00a0trying to protect. And it\u2019s important to be able to answer the questions with confidence, and know\u00a0what source we\u2019re referring. From my experience and those of colleagues at Viva!,\u00a0here are some of the most frequently asked questions in terms of the environment.\u00a0\u00a0","6":"This page covers general questions, the next page covers slightly more complicated questions and the page after that looks into specific food issues such as almonds and quinoa.\u00a0\u00a0","7":"A - \u2018There has been a lot of coverage of the damage done to the Amazon rainforest from soya production, but only 6 per cent of all global soya consumption is actually used on human food, and a lot of that goes into things like bread and chocolate, which everyone eats. The vast majority of deforestation in the Amazon and elsewhere for soya has actually been to grow soya as a cheap crop for animals, or to set up huge cattle farming.\u00a0\u00a0","8":"About 70 per cent of all soya is used for animal agriculture, 24 per cent for biofuel and 6 per cent for human consumption. Because animals eat far more calories than they produce through their flesh, dairy or eggs, it\u2019s an incredibly inefficient system.\u00a0\u00a0","9":"Vegan diets use less than half the land required by omnivorous diets. So soya is doing harm, but actually because of animal agriculture rather than directly feeding humans.\u2019\u00a0","10":"A - Within the echo chambers of the vegan world, I\u2019m very aware\u00a0that this is a bit of a joke question when us vegans lounge about and take aim at non-vegans. That\u2019s between vegans, of course. But I\u2019ve been asked this question quite a few times in recent months. And while it might be a simple answer it\u2019s good to get it\u00a0out there.\u00a0\u00a0","11":"The world isn\u2019t going to go vegan overnight, so we won\u2019t ever be in a position where we\u2019ve suddenly got billions of animals that we don\u2019t want to eat any more but need to keep alive. As the demand for vegan products rises and the demand for animal products falls, there will be a gradual shift as fewer and fewer animals are bred for farming. It\u2019s a gradual shift. There are only several billion farmed animals alive today because humans forcibly impregnate them or artificially arrange for them to\u00a0mate. We won\u2019t need to suddenly kill lots of animals for the sake of the planet, it\u2019ll just be that as fewer animals are forcibly bred, we\u2019ll have far fewer animals who are causing such harm to the planet.\u00a0","12":"A -\u00a0the\u00a0modern, domesticated chicken, cow or sheep has been so artificially manipulated that they live a lot of their life in pain, even if they\u2019re kept in good conditions. For example, the modern chicken has been bred to put on so much weight in such a short space of time that their bones often break under their weight by the age of six weeks.\u00a0\u00a0","13":"The modern dairy cow\u00a0produces far more milk than is healthy for her. These types of cow and chicken aren\u2019t natural. We would either have far fewer of them alive where they can live in sanctuaries, and because there are far fewer of them they won\u2019t be having the environmental impact that billions of them are having today. But there are also wild cows and chickens, who haven\u2019t been genetically manipulated by humans. If we stopped farming chickens and cows, there would still be chickens and cows in the world, but they would not suffer as a result of human intervention.\u00a0\u00a0","14":"The modern broiler chicken - genetically manipulated to grow quickly. As a result they suffer from broken bones, difficulty breathing and high mortality rates at just a few weeks old. Viva!.\u00a0","15":"A - \u2018Grass-fed animals are actually worse for the planet. It takes longer for the animal to reach the weight at which he or she is killed, so the animal lives longer. Because animals consume a huge amount of calories and produce very little in return, and\u00a0because ruminant animals such as cows burp out a huge amount of methane, by having the animals live for longer they\u2019re producing more greenhouse gases, using more water and more land.\u00a0\u00a0","16":"There simply isn\u2019t enough land on the planet to raise all animals in pastures or with more space - it would take several Earths to do that. So it\u2019s not remotely possible for everyone to eat grass-fed animals, and it\u2019s still far more damaging than eating vegan food instead.\u2019\u00a0\u00a0","17":"A -\u00a0It\u2019s\u00a0true that there are some parts of the world which aren\u2019t suitable for crop farming, but do work for certain animals, such as sheep in the Scottish highlands. However, a vegan diet uses far less land than an omnivorous diet. As the population moves towards a vegan diet, there\u2019s less demand on our land, meaning that we will only need to farm the land which does work for arable crops. The parts of the world such as mountainous areas can revert back to a more wild,\u00a0more biodiverse terrain, which is far more beneficial to the planet than having methane-belching sheep or cows.\u00a0\u00a0","18":"A - We\u2019re already in\u00a0a position where we only have\u00a060 years of farming\u00a0left if soil degradation continues, which is an extremely worrying prospect. To state the obvious, without farming, we die. Animal agriculture is actually responsible for a great deal of this soil degradation, so far from helping us with soil, it\u2019s seriously affecting us. The reason why is because animal agriculture is such an inefficient way of consuming calories. Seventy-five per cent of all agricultural land is used for animal agriculture, but it only provides 18 per cent of all calories. We would have far more land to use for rewilding, afforestation, and protecting natural resources\u00a0if we went vegan.\u00a0\u00a0","19":"At a conservative estimate, we would halve the amount of land we\u2019re currently using for farming. This means that we would be able to adopt a far more sustainable system of crop rotation. We could also leave land to\u00a0rewild\u00a0and regenerate, which is crucial not just for soil health but for the climate crisis.\u00a0\u00a0","20":"In terms of manure and compost, there are already some farms which are 100 per cent organic and vegan, proving that you can heal soil without the use of animals. Compost from plant\u00a0sources can regenerate the land, it doesn\u2019t have to come from animals.\u00a0\u00a0","21":"A - A lot of home-grown animals used for meat have been fed on imported crops such as soya or grain from other countries, so vegans aren\u2019t responsible for all imported crops. Even if they were,\u00a0imported vegan sources are still more environmentally sustainable than meat and dairy because they are far more land, water and energy-efficient than animal products.\u00a0\u00a0","22":"But you can also follow a vegan diet, which is largely based on seasonal, local products found in your country, in order to reduce your impact as much as possible. The main thing to bear in mind, however, is that animal products are far more unsustainable than nearly all vegan products wherever they\u2019re sourced from.\u00a0\u00a0","23":"Here\u2019s the answer for particular foods which often crop up (and yes, pun intended).\u00a0\u00a0","24":"A - Palm oil is by definition suitable for vegans, found in over half of all products in supermarkets - even toothpaste and shampoo. It\u2019s not a uniquely vegan issue but as a vegan you might be more inclined to avoid palm oil for ethical reasons.\u00a0","25":"Most oil\u00a0palms grow in areas that were once tropical forests and home to iconic species like the\u00a0orangutan. It is a highly efficient crop producing between six and ten times more oil per acre than soya beans for example and therefore the oil of choice for major businesses. Due to deforestation and the impact it has on biodiversity more and more vegans are chosen to\u00a0opt for alternatives or search for products certified by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO).\u00a0","26":"A - It takes 4.5 litres of water to grow a single almond. The main controversy around almonds has come up because of California\u2019s almond monopoly, where eight in 10 of the world\u2019s almonds are grown. It takes up an estimated\u00a08 per cent\u00a0of the entire water supply in that state which is often affected by drought.\u00a0\u00a0","27":"However, the issue here is not so much almonds but the intense mono-cropping of almonds over a large land mass in an area already\u00a0afflicted by drought. It\u2019s also important to bear in mind that while almonds use up 8 per cent of California\u2019s water, meat and dairy use a staggering\u00a047 per cent. And this doesn\u2019t even include the water that cows drink, water used for sanitation or water used in cleaning slaughterhouses.\u00a0\u00a0","28":"Perhaps it is worth avoiding almond milk grown in California. Not because of veganism but because of monocrops and monopolies. Plenty of vegans don\u2019t consume almond milk at all, after all. But there are plenty of brands which harvest almonds grown in Europe (for those of you who are reading this in Europe). Once again, it\u2019s not as though vegans absolutely must eat almonds grown in California. And the thing\u00a0to keep in mind is that dairy is causing far more of a problem in California and the rest of the world than almonds.\u00a0\u00a0","29":"A - There is a stereotype that it\u2019s just vegans chowing down on avocados which simply is not the case. Just\u00a0like quinoa or palm oil, it\u2019s a product that many people eat. It just so happens to be that vegans living on nothing but avocados is a stereotype that sticks with a lot of people.\u00a0\u00a0","30":"But it is true that avocados do require a lot of water compared to other\u00a0vegan sources. And if you\u2019re living in Britain or elsewhere in Europe, they may have been flown over from places thousands of miles away. It\u2019s one of those things which has gained a lot more attention than it deserves, and is often portrayed in a misleading way. Avocados still have a lower impact than animal products. For example, avocados have a greenhouse emissions footprint which is almost one tenth that of\u00a0pork. And avocados have\u00a0a total water footprint of\u00a01981\u00a0\u33a5\/ton, compared to\u00a015,400\u00a0\u33a5\/ton\u00a0for beef and\u00a03,300\u00a0\u33a5\/ton\u00a0for eggs, the least damaging of animal products. So even compared to the least damaging animal product, avocados still are far less demanding with regards to water. Avocados are bad compared to other vegan sources. When compared to animal options, they\u2019re good.\u00a0\u00a0","31":"It\u2019s one of those products which should be looked into, and if you are keen to limit your environmental footprint then it is worth looking into where you\u2019re sourcing your avocados from. You might also want to consider minimising the number of avocados that you eat. But if you\u2019re comparing avocados to animal products, they\u2019re still more environmentally friendly. And again, you can be vegan and choose not to eat avocados.\u00a0\u00a0","32":"A - Once again quinoa is consumed by lots of people, not just vegans. It\u2019s a big one for gluten-intolerant people, for example, or those who choose healthier grains to eat.\u00a0\u00a0","33":"It\u2019s been criticised for the impact it might have had on farmers in South America, with the idea being that it\u2019s become so expensive that it\u2019s forced farmers into hunger or malnutrition. When you actually look into the details of it, however, the boom in quinoa has in many ways been advantageous to the farmers who now sell it for a high profit elsewhere. A study published by the International Trade Centre (ITC), the joint agency of the UN and World Trade Organisation based in Geneva shows that in Peru high quinoa prices in fact improved the welfare of poor rural communities. As prices rose between 2004 and 2013, quinoa farmers (who are among the poorest people in Peru), saw a\u00a046 per cent\u00a0increase in their welfare.\u00a0","34":"There are 3,000 varieties of quinoa which can grow in several different climates. There\u2019s even quinoa grown in\u00a0Britain, so that\u2019s a really good option if you\u2019re not certain about its impact elsewhere and want to cut down on food imports.\u00a0\u00a0","35":"The thing to bear in mind (once again) is that quinoa is not a uniquely vegan issue. It\u2019s the same as saying that vegans are to blame\u00a0for the global expansion of coffee, because some vegans consume coffee. True, but then again several omnivores consume coffee as well. That goes for palm oil, quinoa, almonds and avocados. So when discussing these particular foods (or any other food someone may bring up) rather than just trying to say that the crops have no issue at all, do bring up the fact that they\u2019re consumed by those who eat animal products as well. Seeing as there\u2019s only about two per cent of Brits who are vegan, unless\u00a0we are eating\u00a0an extraordinary amount of avocados it\u2019s extremely likely that the vast majority of avocados are consumed by omnivores. The media just paints it as a vegan issue to have a story. When you look into it, these stories very rarely compare avocados to animal products.\u00a0\u00a0","36":"A - There are some other arguments about particular crops such as wasps and figs or bees used in almond pollination.\u00a0","37":"The argument against vegans eating avocados is based on the fact that bees are needed to pollinate them and in some areas like California in the US, there are not enough local bees for the pollination of the massive fruit, vegetable and nut-farms so bees are transported in. There are many smaller farms that rely on natural bee populations and in an ideal world, we should try and buy from them as much as possible. According to the New Agriculturalist and the American Beekeeping Federation, beans, tomatoes, apples, broccoli, melons, carrots, onions and hundreds of other fruits, vegetables and grains are also pollinated by bees bred for commercial purposes.\u00a0\u00a0","38":"As vegans, we just do our absolute best according to what\u2019s practical and possible. This is a bit like the \u2018figs are not vegan\u2019 story based on\u00a0how female fig wasps can become trapped and die in figs when laying their eggs in them \u2013 it\u2019s part of the natural pollination process as opposed to humans\u2019 systematic mistreatment of farmed animals. Almonds, avocados and figs remain a lot more vegan than\u00a0beef burgers and milkshakes \u2013 and don\u2019t forget \u2013 all these farmed animals are fed plant foods too, so even if there are issues within plant foods it\u2019s dramatically minimised by eating far more efficient, vegan diets.\u00a0","39":"Veganism is ultimately about living in\u00a0a way which seeks to exclude, as far as is possible and practicable, all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose \u2013 any step towards doing this is better than no step!\u00a0","40":"It would be impossible to cover every single possible question someone might ask about veganism. I\u2019ve been doing activism for over eight years and had thousands of conversations. I\u2019m still surprised at some of the questions\u00a0I get asked, and I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be in the same situation in five years\u2019 time.\u00a0\u00a0","41":"But I hope that the previous chapters have covered a lot of the most frequently asked questions. With each question, I could have gone into even more detail if I needed to. But\u00a0it\u2019s important to remember that we shouldn\u2019t bombard people with too much information. People lose interest and stop listening, and then don\u2019t remember anything because you\u2019ve said too much. Keep it simple, know a good number of facts, and remember that the essential message. Animal products use far more land, water and energy than plant products. Going\u00a0vegan is the single biggest action any individual can take for the planet.","42":"That is the main message we need to bring across.\u00a0"},"description":{"0":"lesson","1":"lesson","2":"lesson","3":"lesson","4":"lesson","5":"lesson","6":"lesson","7":"lesson","8":"lesson","9":"lesson","10":"lesson","11":"lesson","12":"lesson","13":"lesson","14":"lesson","15":"lesson","16":"lesson","17":"lesson","18":"lesson","19":"lesson","20":"lesson","21":"lesson","22":"lesson","23":"lesson","24":"lesson","25":"lesson","26":"lesson","27":"lesson","28":"lesson","29":"lesson","30":"lesson","31":"lesson","32":"lesson","33":"lesson","34":"lesson","35":"lesson","36":"lesson","37":"lesson","38":"lesson","39":"lesson","40":"lesson","41":"lesson","42":"lesson"},"url":{"0":"https:\/\/veganbootcamp.org\/course-progress\/745\/introduction","1":"https:\/\/veganbootcamp.org\/course-progress\/745\/introduction","2":"https:\/\/veganbootcamp.org\/course-progress\/745\/introduction","3":"https:\/\/veganbootcamp.org\/course-progress\/745\/introduction","4":"https:\/\/veganbootcamp.org\/course-progress\/745\/introduction","5":"https:\/\/veganbootcamp.org\/course-progress\/746\/first-the-simple-questions","6":"https:\/\/veganbootcamp.org\/course-progress\/746\/first-the-simple-questions","7":"https:\/\/veganbootcamp.org\/course-progress\/746\/first-the-simple-questions","8":"https:\/\/veganbootcamp.org\/course-progress\/746\/first-the-simple-questions","9":"https:\/\/veganbootcamp.org\/course-progress\/746\/first-the-simple-questions","10":"https:\/\/veganbootcamp.org\/course-progress\/746\/first-the-simple-questions","11":"https:\/\/veganbootcamp.org\/course-progress\/746\/first-the-simple-questions","12":"https:\/\/veganbootcamp.org\/course-progress\/746\/first-the-simple-questions","13":"https:\/\/veganbootcamp.org\/course-progress\/746\/first-the-simple-questions","14":"https:\/\/veganbootcamp.org\/course-progress\/746\/first-the-simple-questions","15":"https:\/\/veganbootcamp.org\/course-progress\/747\/the-more-detailed-questions","16":"https:\/\/veganbootcamp.org\/course-progress\/747\/the-more-detailed-questions","17":"https:\/\/veganbootcamp.org\/course-progress\/747\/the-more-detailed-questions","18":"https:\/\/veganbootcamp.org\/course-progress\/747\/the-more-detailed-questions","19":"https:\/\/veganbootcamp.org\/course-progress\/747\/the-more-detailed-questions","20":"https:\/\/veganbootcamp.org\/course-progress\/747\/the-more-detailed-questions","21":"https:\/\/veganbootcamp.org\/course-progress\/748\/the-specific-food-questions","22":"https:\/\/veganbootcamp.org\/course-progress\/748\/the-specific-food-questions","23":"https:\/\/veganbootcamp.org\/course-progress\/748\/the-specific-food-questions","24":"https:\/\/veganbootcamp.org\/course-progress\/748\/the-specific-food-questions","25":"https:\/\/veganbootcamp.org\/course-progress\/748\/the-specific-food-questions","26":"https:\/\/veganbootcamp.org\/course-progress\/748\/the-specific-food-questions","27":"https:\/\/veganbootcamp.org\/course-progress\/748\/the-specific-food-questions","28":"https:\/\/veganbootcamp.org\/course-progress\/748\/the-specific-food-questions","29":"https:\/\/veganbootcamp.org\/course-progress\/748\/the-specific-food-questions","30":"https:\/\/veganbootcamp.org\/course-progress\/748\/the-specific-food-questions","31":"https:\/\/veganbootcamp.org\/course-progress\/748\/the-specific-food-questions","32":"https:\/\/veganbootcamp.org\/course-progress\/748\/the-specific-food-questions","33":"https:\/\/veganbootcamp.org\/course-progress\/748\/the-specific-food-questions","34":"https:\/\/veganbootcamp.org\/course-progress\/748\/the-specific-food-questions","35":"https:\/\/veganbootcamp.org\/course-progress\/748\/the-specific-food-questions","36":"https:\/\/veganbootcamp.org\/course-progress\/748\/the-specific-food-questions","37":"https:\/\/veganbootcamp.org\/course-progress\/748\/the-specific-food-questions","38":"https:\/\/veganbootcamp.org\/course-progress\/748\/the-specific-food-questions","39":"https:\/\/veganbootcamp.org\/course-progress\/748\/the-specific-food-questions","40":"https:\/\/veganbootcamp.org\/course-progress\/749\/conclusion","41":"https:\/\/veganbootcamp.org\/course-progress\/749\/conclusion","42":"https:\/\/veganbootcamp.org\/course-progress\/749\/conclusion"}}
