Now this myth is constantly being broken by top athletes, bodybuilders, and models.","1":"As demonstrated by the athletes and research featured in\u00a0The Game Changers documentary, switching to a diet centered around plants can yield significant performance advantages, providing optimal fuel, increasing blood flow, making muscles more efficient, and speeding recovery by lowering inflammation. These benefits can not only be experienced by athletes, but by anyone who wants to feel and perform better in any aspect of their lives.","2":"Being vegan can give you a real edge when it comes to your health and overall well-being. But you will miss out on these advantages if you ignore fitness and live a sedentary lifestyle.","3":"Fitness isn\u2019t optional, and the payoff for avoiding a sedentary lifestyle is multifaceted. You\u2019ll get better sleep and a healthier body weight. Your mood and energy levels will improve, plus you\u2019ll face fewer health risks,\u00a0including diabetes. Cellular aging appears to\u00a0slow dramatically\u00a0as fitness levels increase. There\u2019s even evidence that good fitness\u00a0may prevent\u00a0the decline in mental capacity often associated with aging. Perhaps most importantly, basic fitness can reduce aches and pains and help you to feel clearer and happier day-to-day.","4":"How much time and commitment does it take to reap the benefits of improved fitness? Surprisingly little. The Mayo Clinic says that\u00a0just 150 minutes\u00a0a week of moderate intensity exercise delivers substantial benefits. That\u2019s barely 20 minutes a day doing something as easy and accessible as brisk walking. What\u2019s more, if you do something aerobically rigorous, Mayo says you only need 75 minutes of exercise a week.","5":"Written by Veggies for Thought, visit his youtube channel by clicking here.","6":"For the vast majority of the population, nutrition and health are very confusing subjects. This confusion stems in part from the fact that most people look for information on these subjects online (1), where anyone with an opinion, regardless of their credentials, can pose as an authority and reach millions of people.","7":"Since most people aren\u2019t trained in nutrition and\/or don\u2019t have the time to read or interpret the actual research, this means that the companies and self-proclaimed experts with the most advertising dollars and\/or the savviest social media strategies end up influencing the most people.","8":"Making matters worse, countless studies are funded by food companies and lobby groups with the goal of making their product(s) seem ideal for athletic performance, weight loss and\/or health. This \u201cscientific research\u201d filters down to doctors, who, in the United States, only receive an average of 20 hours of nutrition training during their entire medical education (2), and usually don\u2019t have time to stay up to date on the most recent research. It also makes its way to dietitians and nutritionists \u2014 whose educational materials are also often funded by these same companies and lobby groups \u2014 as well as coaches, personal trainers, and other fitness\/athletic professionals, who often base their recommendations on very outdated concepts.","9":"\u201cThe formula works beautifully for people selling food. It works beautifully for people selling drugs to treat the diseases that bad food causes. And it works beautifully for the media, which can give us a new story about diet every day.\u201d","10":"As a result, most people feel overwhelmed and confused by all of the conflicting nutritional information they come across \u2014\u00a0Are carbs good or bad? Is exercise the key to weight loss? Should I really put butter in my coffee?\u00a0\u2014 bouncing from one fad diet to another, or simply giving up and going back to their old eating habits.","11":"Despite all of the confusion in the general population, decades of research from the world\u2019s most trusted research institutions, published in the world\u2019s most respected scientific journals, have painted a very clear picture of which eating patterns tend to improve health and fitness, and which do not.","12":"The preponderance of scientific evidence suggests that an animal-based diet \u2014 where foods like meat, eggs and dairy are the foundation of most meals \u2014 decreases overall health, increases the risk of numerous diseases, and reduces our lifespans. Conversely, the more plants you eat, the healthier you tend to be, decreasing your risk of many major diseases while increasing the quality and length of our lives.","13":"This basic but powerful conclusion has been reached via many fields of research, including epidemiology (population studies), nutritional biochemistry (how food affects the body), and biological anthropology (which includes the study of what humans are \u2018built\u2019 to eat). We dig deeper into these subjects in\u00a0Optimizing Health.","14":"The same underlying mechanisms that impact health (including blood flow, oxidative stress, inflammation, and hormone levels) also affect athletic performance, sexual function,\u00a0body composition, cognitive function, and many other areas that play a major role in how we look, feel, and function. We discuss how food\u2019s powerful influence over these mechanisms can affect athletics and fitness in\u00a0Maximizing Performance.","15":"Another consistent nutritional principle is that whole foods tend to be healthier than processed\/refined foods. We prefer to use the term \u2018refined\u2019, since processing a food could simply mean chopping or cooking it, whereas refining a food typically means\u00a0removing\u00a0some or much of its nutrient content. For example, chopping a beet is technically \u2018processing\u2019 it, but \u2018refining\u2019 a beet into table sugar requires stripping away the fiber, folate, potassium, iron, and vitamin C, leaving only sugar. The same applies to the production of oils, white flours, and so on, where fiber and other key nutrients are removed in the refining process.","16":"Refined foods can also include\u00a0added ingredients, such as the preservatives found in processed meats, or the artificial flavors and colors found in candy.","17":"While most people understand that sugary drinks like soda, fried foods like potato chips, and refined flour products like white bread or pastries are definitely\u00a0not\u00a0ideal for optimizing health or fitness, few people understand that a diet based on animal foods \u2014 whether whole (like chicken breast and eggs) or heavily processed (like bacon and cheese) \u2014 is of far greater concern than misguided fears like\u00a0\u201ceating too many carbs\u201d. And even fewer understand that the overwhelming body of scientific evidence shows that choosing a diet centered around a wide variety of plants, especially in their whole form, is the single most powerful tool we have for the prevention, treatment, and even\u00a0reversal\u00a0of many of our most common diseases.","18":"While nutrition can be a very confusing subject, researchers from a wide range of scientific disciplines agree on some very basic principles of what the optimal diet for performance and health looks like. This diet centers around plants with an emphasis on a wide variety of whole foods, whenever possible.","19":"As clearly demonstrated in\u00a0The Game Changers, a rapidly increasing number of world-class athletes are taking advantage of this knowledge and experiencing dramatic improvements in their performance as a result, smashing records and stereotypes along the way. While some people mistakenly believe that all of these athletes have personal chefs and\/or superior genes, the reality is that there are also tens of millions around the world from all walks of life experiencing similar\u00a0benefits, helping them look, feel and perform at their very best.","20":"The text above was written by\u00a0GamesChangersMovie.com, for sources\u00a0please click here\u00a0and scroll down and click \"Pages References\" to find those studies. Thank you! ","21":"\u201cThe formula works beautifully for people selling food. It works beautifully for people selling drugs to treat the diseases that bad food causes. And it works beautifully for the media, which can give us a new story about diet every day.\u201dDR. DAVID KATZ, FOUNDING DIRECTOR OF YALE UNIVERSITY\u2019S YALE-GRIFFIN PREVENTION RESEARCH CENTER ","22":"Hard-working muscles run primarily on glycogen, a form of carbohydrate stored in our liver and muscle. Carbohydrates, which come almost exclusively from plants, also provide our brain with its primary and preferred fuel \u2014 glucose \u2014 which helps us stay sharp and focused during intense training sessions and competitions (1).","23":"Performance-based diets built around meat and other animal products often provide dietary fat at the expense of carbohydrates (2,3). Unlike carbohydrates, fat can\u2019t produce energy fast enough to meet the demands of intense exercise, so diets that sacrifice carbohydrates typically impair high-intensity performance (1). Low-carbohydrate diets, including the ketogenic (keto) diet, have been shown to cause so much fatigue that they even affect our motivation to\u00a0begin\u00a0a training session, let alone finish it (4-6).","24":"Protein can also be used as a fuel source, but it\u2019s highly inefficient, wasting 20-30% of each calorie as heat (7). All told, carbohydrates are the ideal source of energy for optimized performance, whether it\u2019s doing squats, playing football, or running a marathon. ","25":"And as we\u2019ll discuss later in\u00a0Getting and Staying Lean, despite the common misconception that \u201ccarbs make you fat\u201d,\u00a0unrefined\u00a0carbohydrates \u2014 like those found in whole plant foods, including oats, sweet potatoes, and bananas \u2014 are consistently associated with\u00a0decreased\u00a0body fat, another advantage for most performance goals.","26":"Efficient blood flow is another cornerstone for optimized performance, since blood is how oxygen and vital nutrients reach the cells in our muscles, brain, and the rest of our body, while also helping to eliminate waste (8).","27":"Just as the experiment conducted on three NFL players in\u00a0The Game Changers\u00a0revealed, a single animal-based meal can quickly thicken our blood (9), which slows down the flow of oxygen and the nutrients blood transports to the areas that need it most, including the muscles we use during exercise (10). People who avoid meat experience the opposite effect, since plant-based meals allow blood to remain fluid and flow quickly to its destination (11).","28":"Adding insult to injury, animal-based meals can cripple our arteries, preventing them from fully opening to allow for increased blood flow. Research has shown that just two hours after eating a heavy animal-based meal, arteries can constrict by 40%, essentially causing a traffic jam. The calorie-matched plant-based meal allowed them to open freely for quick, easy transit (12).","29":"But it isn\u2019t just the lack of \u201cbaggage\u201d in plant foods that help keep our blood flowing quickly; there is also a common ingredient found in plant-based foods like spinach, lettuce, carrots, and beets that actually signals our blood vessels to open, allowing more blood to flow through at a faster pace (13). This ingredient is nitrates which, unlike the cancer-causing nitrates in cured meats like bacon (14), serves another important function.","30":"The energy reserves our muscles use for intense training or competition are limited, and when we run out, we\u2019ve reached the end of line. The more efficiently our muscles work, the further these energy reserves can take us.","31":"In addition to encouraging our arteries to expand, the nitrates found in plant foods also allow our muscles to contract more efficiently, sparing their energy reserves and allowing them to accomplish more work with the same amount of effort (15). This translates into measurably better performance, whether it\u2019s lifting weights at the gym, playing football, or running sprints (16).","32":"Inflammation is our bodies\u2019 natural immune response to injury, foreign invaders, or even exercise. In its\u00a0acute\u00a0form, like after spraining an ankle, coming down with a bacterial infection, or recovering from a workout, inflammation is an immediate and necessary part of the healing process. Left unchecked, or further intensified, inflammation can prolong healing time from injuries or sickness, and also increase soreness and swelling, slowing recovery between workouts and competitions.","33":"Chronic\u00a0inflammation often begins with the same cellular response, but shifts in nature when the immune system fails to heal the injury effectively, eliminate the foreign invaders, or continues to respond to a threat that no longer exists. Once it reaches this stage, inflammation often begins damaging\u00a0healthy\u00a0tissues, including muscles and joints (17).","34":"Taking all of this into account, unnecessary inflammation can have a significant negative impact on our physical performance (18).","35":"Fortunately, diet can be a powerful tool to get us through acute inflammation faster and combat chronic inflammation as well. But it can also have the opposite effect.","36":"Animal-based diets fall into the latter category. Extensive research has shown that meat and other animal products contain (or lead to the formation of) a wide range of\u00a0pro-inflammatory compounds and molecules, including bacterial endotoxins, trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), nitrosamines, heterocyclic amines (HCAs), N-Glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) (19-23). If these words sound scary, you\u2019re right: the damage they inflict can be severe, with research showing that a single hamburger can increase measures of inflammation by 70 percent (24).","37":"Plants fall on the opposite end of this spectrum, coming naturally packed with high doses of\u00a0anti-inflammatory compounds, including thousands of powerful antioxidants. The contrast between these two classes of food is dramatic, with plants having on average\u00a064 times\u00a0the antioxidant content of animal foods (25). This helps explain why switching to a plant-based diet can help reduce measures of inflammation by 29 percent in just\u00a0three weeks\u00a0(26).","38":"Not surprisingly, numerous studies have shown that the anti-inflammatory nature of plant foods can help decrease soreness, reduce muscle damage, and support recovery \u2014 all of which contribute to improved performance (27-31).","39":"Eating plants also combats the inflammation caused by animal foods (24,32). Therefore, decreasing animal foods while increasing plant foods has a dual effect: it not only replaces pro-inflammatory compounds with anti-inflammatory ones, but also frees up the beneficial plant compounds to address the inflammation caused by exercise, injury, and sickness (33).","40":"The reduction in both acute and chronic inflammation reveals why so many plant-based athletes, including those featured in\u00a0The Game Changers, report reduced DOMS (delayed onset muscle soreness), quicker recovery times after workouts and competitions, faster healing from injuries, reduced tendonitis and joint pain, improved immunity, and significantly increased career longevity.","41":"Whether you\u2019re a competitive athlete, weekend warrior, or someone who simply wants to feel and perform better in the gym, at work, or at home, eating more plants and removing all animal products can provide powerful advantages. As we\u2019ll see in\u00a0Optimizing Health, eating a diet centered around plants can also have a dramatic effect on our health.","42":"For more on the effect plant-based eating can have on specific areas of performance and fitness, please visit\u00a0Gaining Muscle and Strength,\u00a0Going the Distance, and\u00a0Getting and Staying Lean.","43":"The text above was written by GamesChangersMovie.com, for sources please click here and scroll down and click \"Pages References\" to find those studies.
