Consult a dietitian before changing the diet of your child.","1":"Before we tackle what a healthy and vegan diet for children looks like, let's first discuss the consensus of doing so for the health of your child. The American Diet Association states in an article: \"It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.\" (source)","2":"The British Diet Organization is even working together with The Vegan Society, as they are also of the opinion that a vegan diet is healthy for all stages of life: Both organizations [The Vegan Society and the The British Diet Organization] will \u201cwork together to show that it is possible to follow a well-planned, plant-based, vegan-friendly diet that supports healthy living in people of all ages, and during pregnancy and breastfeeding\u201d and \u201cpromote reliable, evidence based advice on a healthy vegan diet to members of the public, services users, and medical professionals.\u201d (source)","3":"Diet associations of other countries have taken a standpoint in this case. For example, the Dutch version (Voedingscentrum) also declared veganism healthy for children, but they do recommend a vitamin B12 supplement and advice from dietitians. If your local diet association has a similar standpoint, let us know and we can provide it on Vegan Bootcamp as a resource. (source)","4":"Hopefully, it feels less scary to let your child become vegan with the support of various diet associations. However, it is a fact that children need different intakes of macros (protein, carbohydrates and fats) and micros (vitamins and minerals), so you shouldn't take this lightly. Luckily, the Vegan Society has a wealth of information on their website regarding which aspects of a child's vegan diet require extra attention. Follow this link to find the information.","5":"In general, here are some key elements to pay attention to:","6":"Everyone should make sure they ingest all nutrients. This includes people with an omnivorous diet. However, a vegan diet can be new so all vegans should pay extra attention to their diet, especially in the beginning. And to reiterate, this page is not a replacement for medical advice. (source)","7":"As stated before, this is not a replacement of medical advice. Don't take a risk with your own or your children's health. Nobody is a bad parent for seeking advice from a dietitian or other medical adviser. If anything, it makes you a better parent. We recommend that everyone seeks this medical advice, especially for their children. ","8":"We also recommend a dietitian that supports a vegan diet. Unfortunately, some dietitians are still against veganism, especially for children. As you've already learned, it has been proven that well-planned vegan diets are healthy at any stage of life. Someone who isn't in support of veganism is not only uninformed but, as a consquence, someone that cannot help you properly. Make sure that you find a dietitian that is right for you and your family.","9":"If you choose, despite our recommendation, to not consult medical advice, please pay close attention to your child. Certain behavioral and health effects can indicate shortages in their diet. In case you see these signs, consult a dietitian as soon as possible. The signs to look out for include:","10":"(source)","11":"Dietitian Heather Russell provides a kids' meal plan as well as fun ways to introduce the great fruit and vegetable adventure to young children.","12":"Fruit and vegetables are an important part of meals and snacks, providing you and your child with vital fibre, vitamins and minerals. Whether your child is vegan already or going vegan, this blog will give you some ideas about how to help them get their 5-a-day and make their eating experiences as positive as possible.\u00a0","13":"If you\u2019ve got a bit more time at the weekend, why not prepare a cooked breakfast? Below you\u2019ll find some great ideas, all of which count as one of your 5-a-day. \u00a0As a rough guide, one portion is the amount that your child can fit in their hand (apart from dried fruit).","14":"Beans, chickpeas and lentils are important sources of protein, iron and zinc in vegan diets. Did you know that a serving can count as one of your 5-a-day?","15":"Fruit is a nutritious and delicious dessert. The following examples could be served with fortified soya alternatives to yoghurt or custard:","16":"Fruit and vegetables are great snack foods and sometimes they can even be subsidised. For example, if your child is four to six years old and attends a state-funded school in England, they are entitled to receive a free piece of fruit or vegetable every school day. Other countries may offer similar schemes, so get checking.","17":"Your child might be hungry at home time, so make sure that they\u2019ve got some fruit to keep them going as it\u2019s a good source of slow-burning energy. At home, keep a fruit bowl within easy reach to encourage healthy snacking. If you are washing and chopping fruit and vegetables for a meal, seize the opportunity to prepare extra for snacks.","18":"This suggested meal plan will help you and your child to enjoy fruit and vegetables throughout the day:","19":"Breakfast","20":"Mid-morning","21":"Lunch","22":"Mid-afternoon","23":"Evening meal","24":"Breakfast\u00a0","25":"Mid-morning","26":"Lunch","27":"Mid-afternoon","28":"Evening meal","29":"Ground linseed is a source of essential omega-3 fat, which can be stirred into yoghurt and cereal, or blended into smoothies. You can buy large packs of whole linseed, blend a small quantity, and store it in an airtight container in the fridge to make sure it remains nutritious.","30":"Did you know that calcium-set tofu is a great source of calcium? Fortified alternatives to milk and yoghurt are full of the mineral, too. Include these calcium-rich foods in most of your child\u2019s meals in order to help them hit their daily calcium target.","31":"Beans, chickpeas, lentils, tofu and peanuts provide protein, iron and zinc. Adding sources of vitamin C may help your child to absorb more iron. Pepper, broccoli, cabbage, Brussels sprouts, kiwi fruits, oranges, strawberries, pineapple, grapefruit and orange juice are rich in vitamin C.","32":"Vitamin D supplementation is recommended for everyone in the UK during autumn and winter. Year round supplementation is recommended for some groups, including people who do not regularly expose their skin to sunlight, those with darker skin, and children under the age of five years (apart from those consuming more than 500ml of infant formula daily)*.","33":"Every vegan needs a reliable source of vitamin B12 and iodine in their diet. Vitamin B12 can be obtained from fortified foods or a\u00a0supplement*. Arguably a supplement is the best way of providing iodine*. Seaweed is rich in iodine, but the content is variable, and some varieties contain too much iodine or contaminants.","34":"*Please discuss the use of supplements with a health professional to ensure that they are suitable for your child.","35":"The process of learning to like new foods takes time, and positive experiences will help your child to enjoy eating a variety of fruit and vegetables. Here are some tips:","36":"There are lots of ways to make eating fruit and vegetables fun. Here are some ideas:","37":"Growing fruit and vegetables is a brilliant way to get your kids excited about eating them. You don\u2019t need to have lots of space because they can be grown in containers.","38":"Ideally, fruit and vegetables should be introduced in a way that allows your child to recognise them. However, there are many ways of adding fruit and vegetables to other foods, which can boost nutritional value. Vegetables can be added to or blended into sauces. You can even increase the fibre, vitamin and mineral contents of cakes! Dates can be used as a sweetener, and you can find recipes that include beans, beetroot, butternut squash, carrot, chickpeas, courgette, parsnip, pumpkin or sweet potato.","39":"Vegan Richa lists 35 kid-friendly vegan recipes!","40":"Kids\u00a0can be tough to feed at times.
