We all need to find a way of eating healthy and vegan on a budget until we have enough money to not care as much.","1":"There's a very common misunderstanding of healthy, plant-based food being exceptionally expensive. This might stem from the idea that we have to buy expensive supplements, powders, superfoods or vegan meat and dairy substitutes in order to sustain this lifestyle.","2":"These things can be nice to have but aren't really necessary to thrive and be healthy. If you strip it down to the basics, you will find that the whole food plant based lifestyle can actually be dirt cheap and easily affordable for anyone.","3":"With a little bit of knowledge, a healthy diet bursting with taste and nutrients will fit your budget even if you have to count every penny.","4":"The following 14 tips will get you the most bang for your buck.","5":"Restaurant or diner meals are much more expensive compared to self-made ones since you're paying for the service. Eating out should only be a very occasional treat or avoided altogether if you're on a budget.","6":"In times of being on the move, try to prepare meals or snacks in advance and take them with you in a lunch box. This way you also have full control over what goes into your meals and aren't dependent on restaurant foods that might have some shady ingredients in them.","7":"When you prepare your own meals, consider cooking large batches and freeze the leftovers in meal-sized containers.","8":"Whole, plant foods are loaded with all the essential nutrients your body needs and should be the base of your diet. The great thing about these unprocessed and pure foods is that they are also the cheapest ones out there, especially the starchy foods.","9":"So make sure, you base your recipes around these low-priced yet super healthy and nutrient dense goodies.","10":"Some budget friendly foods include:\u200b","11":"Starches","12":"Brown rice, potatoes, pumpkin, millet, oats, whole-grain pasta","13":"Vegetables","14":"Carrots, broccoli, cabbage, beets, all sorts of leafy greens such as kale or spinach, frozen vegetables","15":"Fruits","16":"Apples, bananas, pears, plums, oranges, other fruit depending on the season","17":"Legumes","18":"Almost all beans and lentils (you can save extra if you buy them dry and soak\/cook them yourself instead of going for the pre-cooked versions \u2013 that way you get much bigger amounts for your money and also cut out the sodium that's usually found in canned legumes)","19":"Nuts","20":"Peanuts, other nuts such as almonds or walnuts when bought in bulk","21":"Big packages or family packs usually provide much better value for cost than small containers or bags. Look out for the unit price which tells you the exact cost per pound, liter etc. This makes it easy to compare between products and choose the cheapest option.","22":"Look for the bulk section of your\u00a0grocery store\u00a0or maybe there's even an entire bulk food store nearby? These places let you load up on items such as oats, rice, pasta, nuts or seeds for a very good price since you're not buying for packaging or a brand name.","23":"Simple doesn't have to mean boring. Make starches your base and experiment with simple but flavorful ingredients and spices. Not stuffing your recipes with too many ingredients will make things easier on your digestion, too. Think of baked potatoes with\u00a0homemade \ufeffketchup, roasted pumpkin with\u00a0guacamole\u00a0or\u00a0banana ice cream.\u00a0Sounds delicious, right?","24":"Have a look at some other simple but tasty recipes to get inspired:","25":"Find our 40+ delicious & easy vegan recipes as well as a\u00a0full 14-day meal plan here.","26":"If you recognize that you bought too many fruits or vegetables and they're about to turn bad, go ahead and freeze them. Ripe or even overripe fruit can still be frozen and turned into a delicious smoothie later on. Frozen vegetables can make a tasty stew or soup.","27":"Whenever you find an exceptionally good deal on fresh produce, you can stock up and freeze them as well.","28":"Source: https:\/\/nutriciously.com\/how-to-eat-healthy-on-a-budget\/","29":"It absolutely doesn\u2019t have to be!\u00a0Most store cupboard essentials \u2013 like pasta, rice, potatoes, beans, tinned tomatoes, lentils and fresh seasonal or frozen veggies \u2013 are cheap, and you\u2019re likely to be buying those anyway.","30":"Besides, meat is really expensive. A joint of meat or a piece of fish is probably the most pricey thing you will buy in a supermarket outside of the alcohol aisle. And the price you pay for meat and other animal products is not even the full cost, which is huge when we consider the health and environmental implications, plus the subsidies that all taxpayers contribute to the farming and slaughter of animals.","31":"But what you want to know is: will going vegan blow the weekly budget? And the answer is that most people find little overall difference.\u00a0Some products like dairy-free cheeses and milks are more expensive than the dairy versions but then there are some premium dairy brands that are more expensive still.\u00a0It depends on what you used to buy.","32":"If we compare like for like, we can see, for example, that the cheapest frozen sausage rolls that Tesco sells are \u00a31.25 per kilo with the most expensive being \u00a34.20 per kilo. Vegan frozen sausage rolls are \u00a32.50 per kilo, which is certainly competitive. Quorn\u2019s vegan fishless fingers are \u00a37.50 a kilo, while the ones made with fish range from \u00a32.50 to \u00a39.30 a kilo.","33":"For those who bought at the cheaper end of the scale, choosing the vegan options might be a greater expense than they are used to.\u00a0But, the overall basket price is still likely to stay the same or come down because of the greater amount of fruit and veg you\u2019ll to be buying and enjoying as a vegan, and the fact that you won\u2019t be buying meat. Those who used to buy joints of meat, whole organic chickens or premium dairy brands will almost certainly see the cost of their shopping basket decrease.","34":"Other ways to keep the budget down include cooking from scratch rather than buying processed or pre-packaged foods, bulk-buying staples such as rice and pasta, and cooking up batches of food to freeze for future use.","35":"If you\u2019re on a budget, keep an eye on our\u00a0Recipe\u00a0section for cheap vegan meal ideas, and also check out Jack Monroe\u2019s\u00a0Cooking on a Bootstrap\u00a0blog where you\u2019ll find lots more delicious cheap vegan recipes, including 9p beetburgers.","36":"And if you eat out, you\u2019ll see that the vegan options on menus are almost always cheaper than the meat options.","37":"Written by Veganuary.com, please visit their website by clicking here!","38":"Cheap Lazy Vegan is a youtube channel that has numerous weekly or month food prep guides for incredibly affordable costs - while keeping it delicious!","39":"I would like to leave my mark on this floating rock that we call Earth by showing the world and humanity that being a vegan is not difficult, and that it\u2019s just a simple change in mindset and lifestyle.
