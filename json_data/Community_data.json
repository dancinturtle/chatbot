Check some of the opportunities to connect with like-minded people below! ","1":"Those who become vegan often step outside of the norm of society. While veganism is becoming mainstream in some larger cities, it's still thought of as \"different\" or \"extreme\" by many. More often then not family and friends may ask disheartening questions about veganism. That doesn't mean you won't have non-vegan friends, but they likely won't understand all of your experiences living vegan. For a lot of vegans, a community can help overcome this - a sense of togetherness.","2":"Within the vegan community, you can vent frustrations related to veganism. Some friends may think it's weird you don't want to go to a barbecue, or don't want to celebrate your party without any animal products, and so on. Being able to surround yourself with like-minded compassionate people is one of the most important things you can do as a vegan.","3":"Community can give you hope. Vegans often have and do witness the prevalence and normalization of animal cruelty in society, and in many cases conclude that everything is hopeless. This is especially true for those who do activism. By joining a vegan community, you can see that society is changing and experience some renewed hope. ","4":"Whether you\u2019re\u00a0new to vegan eating\u00a0or a seasoned vegan in a new city, having a support system of like-minded friends is crucial to maintaining your happiness and your ethics. While vegans make up a small part of the population, there\u2019s still a good chance you\u2019ll find like-minded people in your area if you know where to look. With these simple steps, you\u2019ll be meeting vegans near you in no time:","5":"Meetup\u00a0is a great way to meet new people, including vegans! Look for a vegan, vegetarian, or animal rights meetup in your town. If you don\u2019t find one, consider starting your own\u2014it\u2019s easy! And don\u2019t forget to check\u00a0Eventbrite\u00a0for vegan events.","6":"Look for a\u00a0farmed animal sanctuary\u00a0in your area where you can spend time with rescued animals. Not only is this a great way to meet other vegans; it\u2019s a great way to connect with animals who will get to live out their lives in peace.","7":"Sure, it\u2019s online, so it doesn\u2019t really have to be in your area. But there are plenty of\u00a0Facebook groups\u00a0specific to regions or cities. These can help you find out about upcoming events in your area.","8":"Reddit is another great location to find vegan communities. In the next section we'll give you a list of recommendations we think you should check out.","9":"Attend local animal charities\u2019 events, or consider lending your skills and\u00a0volunteering your time. You\u2019re pretty much guaranteed to meet other people who are passionate about protecting animals! (source)","10":"You can find an overview of vegan communities here.

Below are specialist groups that can help whenever you need more information or help in these special circumstances. ","23":"Hospital:Hospitalization, even if just for one day, already isn't a great experience. The fact that many hospitals don't cater to vegans makes things even more stressful. Luckily, there are amazing vegan communities across the globe, and people in various countries will bring vegan food to the hospitalized. ","24":"Some examples of these organizations: 1.

Veganism isn't about perfection; it's about doing what you can.","25":"Prison:There are various reasons people go to prison. Some vegans break the law in their fight against animal abuse. Sometimes, life just happens. While prisons are obligated to give vegan food just like hospitals, this doesn't always happen. Below are resources about your rights and some recommendations for your time in prison.1. Vegan Prisoners Support Group (UK based)2. Vegan Society about vegans in prisons (UK based)3.

Unfortunately, this right is sometimes illegally infringed upon. A number of lawyers give their time to activists and activist organizations to help them stay out of legal trouble. If you are going to participate in this kind of activism, be sure to connect with one or more lawyers that can help you in a hard situation.","27":"Are you missing a specialist group from your country?
