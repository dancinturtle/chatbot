However, there are a number of health risks associated with consuming it. We'll go over some of those risks in the next section.","1":"\"Cow\u2019s milk is promoted as natural, wholesome and healthy\u2013it is none of these things.\"","2":"The saturated fat, animal protein, cholesterol, and hormones that it contains are linked to a wide range of illnesses and diseases. Aggressive marketing of milk and dairy products has resulted in confusion\u2013people simply don't know who to believe.","3":"Most people in the world\u2014over 70 percent\u2014are lactose intolerant. No other animal on the planet continues to drink milk after weaning, let alone the milk of a pregnant mother from another species. It begs the question, are we asking for trouble?","4":"Humans have been drinking milk for only 6,000-8,000 years. This might sound like a very long time but in evolutionary terms, it is very recent history.","5":"If the whole of modern human history was represented by just twelve hours, humans would have started dairy farming just one minute ago! ","6":"Just like us, cows don\u2019t produce milk unless they've given birth. Their children are taken away, and then the milking begins. The modern dairy cow is routinely impregnated while she is still producing milk, to extend the milking period and keep the yield high. The only breather she gets is a small respite near the end of her pregnancy.","7":"At least two-thirds of cow's milk in the UK is taken from pregnant cows, which makes it a rich cocktail of hormones designed to help a young calf grow rapidly into an adult cow in just one year. This is not just limited to the UK, but is standard for most countries in the world.","8":"An intensive cycle of repeated pregnancies follows until she is worn out and her productivity drops, after which she is slaughtered and sold for cheap meat. This intensive physical demand puts a tremendous strain on the dairy cow and, as she gets older, infertility and severe infections causing mastitis and lameness cut her life short. The average lifespan of a modern dairy cow is now only about five years (after three or four lactations), when naturally she would live for 20 to 30 years.","9":"Cow's milk is perfect for calves but not for people. The same is true for the milk of buffalos, badgers, dogs, and rats. The best milk for babies is human breast milk. Cow's milk contains more than twice as much protein and four times as much calcium as human milk, which makes it an ideal fuel for rapid growth.","10":"Human babies grow much more slowly, but our brain development is rapid, which is why breast milk contains five times as much brain-boosting polyunsaturated fat as cow's milk. Milk also carries important chemical 'messenger' molecules that instruct the infant\u2019s immune systems. These features have evolved over thousands of years and are vital in terms of health and disease.","11":"Source: https:\/\/www.vivahealth.org.uk\/healthfeatures\/dairys-white-lies","12":"\"Cow\u2019s milk is promoted as natural, wholesome and healthy\u2013it is none of these things.\"Dr. Justine Butler, PhD, Viva! Health","13":"One of the dairy industry\u2019s biggest misconceptions is the very nature in which cows produce milk. It still surprises many to hear that in order to produce milk a cow first needs to be pregnant, just like us, and that she needs to give birth every year to meet the demands of our high yield modern dairy farming cycle. ","14":"Following a nine month pregnancy the calf is typically removed from his or her mother within 48 hours. The calves receive synthetic milk alternatives so their mothers\u2019 milk can produce more money for farmers\u2019 pockets. The industry argues that this is for the health of the calf! They say that they can better measure the amount of\u00a0colostrum \u2013 a form of milk containing antibodies to protect newborns against disease \u2013\u00a0the calf drinks if it is given artificially.\u00a0In reality it\u2019s simply so we, as human society, can steal all her milk for our own\u00a0consumption.","15":"The separation process is a painfully emotional experience with mother cows bellowing for days, looking for their lost babies. The female calves, or the \u2018replacement milking herd\u2019, are shifted to isolated hutches (think outdoor dog kennel), sometimes just metres away from their mothers. Here they\u2019ll legally spend up to eight weeks before being transferred to group housing with other young females awaiting a life sentence of suffering. It is not uncommon however to find calves up to six months of age still living in isolation, struggling to get inside the hard plastic hutches designed for much smaller animals. (source)","16":"Mother cows have been known to scream for their young, attempt to break out of their pens, break down fences, and go to other extreme lengths in their desperation for reunification. They want to spend time with their offspring. In fact, cows often bond with their mothers for life, remaining in the same herd, when allowed to live naturally.","17":"The extreme distress these cows demonstrate often lead them to refuse water and food. They get sick, become malnourished, and are impregnated again within three or four months. The cycle continues, with each new baby taken away from his or her mother. (source)","18":"Have you ever developed a sudden panicked feeling in a crowded room, such as at a concert? Imagine living in that environment for your entire life. If you watch cows in their natural environments, you\u2019ll notice they spread out. Even heifers give their calves near immediate autonomy. The mother will check in with the baby frequently, but also allow the calf to roam. ","19":"Similarly, although cows are intensely social creatures, you\u2019ll see that they keep space between each other unless there\u2019s a reason to come together. Cows might spend a few minutes grooming each other, for instance, then amicably amble away.","20":" Dairy cows don\u2019t get those luxuries. They live in small pens with no room and no pleasure. They never get the opportunity to explore their world naturally, and many develop serious illnesses and other conditions because they\u2019re kept in such close quarters. ","21":"If the calf is born a male he becomes a useless \u2018by-product\u2019, sold for cheap meat (beef as well as veal) or killed on-farm. The young calf, for example, at the centre of a 2011 Viva! Campaigns investigation into dairy farms supplying Cadbury was shot in the head on the back of a truck and his body handed over to the local fox hounds for food. He was just one of an estimated 95,000 calves that meet their end this way in the UK every year.","22":"The perpetual cycle of forced pregnancies, swift separations from their young as well as unnaturally high milk yields undoubtedly take their toll. For at least seven months of the year she is both pregnant and lactating from a previous pregnancy, visiting the milking parlour twice a day to release an average of 14 litres a time. That\u2019s approximately 28 litres of milk a day!","23":"Having been through the process three to four times by the age of five or six, she is exhausted and experiencing a complete body breakdown. The fuel her body needs to meet the demands of intensive dairy farming simply cannot be met and the reason why dairy herds are often found looking emaciated with their pelvic bones, spine and ribs almost sticking right through their skin.","24":"If you\u2019ve read this far, you have a pretty good understanding of what dairy cows endure on a daily basis. It\u2019s a continuous cycle that involves each cow\u2019s daughters, sons, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren. ","25":"No animal \u2014 dairy cows included \u2014 is built to spend a life in confinement. Cows need to roam, explore the world, find fresh grass, locate water sources, and tend their young. By treating them like lactose vending machines, factory farmers destroy the animals\u2019 spirits and prevent them from experiencing the world as they were intended. Unfortunately, millions of cows endure this treatment, but there\u2019s nobody to save them. (source)","26":"The dairy cow is arguably the hardest worked of all farmed animals, forced into a perpetual cycle of dual pregnancy and lactation, confined to live more than half the year in barren sheds and fed unnatural mixtures of silage. Not being able to consume enough food to keep up with the demands of nurturing an unborn calf while still lactating from a previous pregnancy, whether zero-grazed or not, \u00a0leaves her in a constant state of \u2018metabolic hunger\u2019. It is therefore \u2018normal\u2019 for cows to draw on their body reserves to meet these requirements, resulting in a \u2018coat rack\u2019 appearance where her bones and spine protrude. ","27":"Once her milk yield drops or pregnancy becomes difficult she\u2019s ultimately sent to her death, killed for cheap beef at a fraction of her natural 20 year lifespan. The milk, beef and veal trades are all inextricably linked. But you can help end the abuse; this is no life for any animal. (source)","28":"Don\u2019t be misled by dairy \u201cproducts\u201d with pictures of happy cows running near quaint country barns and reassuring labels proclaiming \u201corganic\u201d or \u201cfree-range.\u201d Cows on typical\u00a0organic and \u201cfree-range\u201d farms\u00a0often spend much of their time confined to crowded sheds or mud-filled pens, just as animals on conventional factory farms do. While the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) requires animals on so-called \u201cfree-range\u201d farms to have access to outdoor areas, it doesn\u2019t specify how much time they must be allowed to spend outside or how much space they should be given.","29":"Cows on organic dairy farms can be kept in crowded sheds, mired in their own waste, much like cows on\u00a0factory dairy farms. They, too, are artificially impregnated every year, and their calves are taken from them soon after birth. Cows on organic farms often aren\u2019t given antibiotics\u2014even when they\u2019re sick or when their udders become infected, something that happens often\u2014because medicated animals lose their \u201corganic\u201d status. (source)","30":"Unfortunately, when it comes to local, the farmers still have to make a profit from said cows to make a living while competing with bigger farms, which means cutting costs like with any other \"product.\" Local or not, cows still need to be forcibly impregnated to produce milk, still die to be sold for meat before they get close to living a full life, and male calves still get killed for veal production as they are useless to dairy farmers.","31":"A global analysis conducted by Sentience Institute suggests over 90% of farmed animals worldwide live on\u00a0factory farms. But the good news in all of this is that we don't need dairy to survive or even thrive, in the next section we'll be going over all of the wonderful, healthy alternatives to cow's milk!","32":"This page presents a summary of Viva!'s extensive fully-referenced scientific report called White Lies. All the facts presented are based on peer-reviewed published research. Full list of sources here.","33":"Cow's milk can increase our hormone levels which have proven to be linked to the cause of acne. This is observed to be even more consequential for teenagers, however bodybuilders, powerlifters, strongmen, and other strength athletes are also at risk due to the consumption of whey protein supplements.","34":"Food allergies cause 10% of eczema and 5% of asthma cases. The most common food triggers for eczema are cow\u2019s milk and eggs. Cow's milk allergy affects 2% of infants under the age of one.","35":"However, a hypersensitive reaction to milk proteins can seriously affect the amount of iron in infants and young children. The proteins can induce hidden gastrointestinal bleeding that may lead to iron deficiency anaemia, which may affect 40% of otherwise healthy-looking infants.","36":"Dairy products make symptoms worse for some, while a low-fat vegan and gluten-free diet has been found to help others. Sulforaphanes (found in broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and cabbage) have anti-inflammatory properties that may help protect against cartilage damage in osteoarthritis. A low-fat vegan diet can be a powerful, positive, and drug-free way of limiting the painful symptoms caused by this disease.","37":"One in two people born after 1960 in the UK will be diagnosed with some sort of cancer during their lifetime. Up to 40% of these cancers could be prevented by lifestyle changes. A poor diet may be responsible for a third of all cancer deaths and is the second largest preventable risk factor for cancer, coming close behind smoking.","38":"Western diets containing meat, dairy, sugar, and highly processed food products can increase the risk of cancer. On the other hand, whole food plant-based diets, which are rich in fibre and antioxidants, lower the risk.","39":"The European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study found that vegans had a 19% lower risk of cancer than meat-eaters (fish-eaters had a 12% lower risk and vegetarians 11% lower). The World Cancer Research Fund says that \u201c\u2026most diets that are protective against cancer are mainly made up from foods of plant origin\u201d.","40":"Milk increases levels of the growth hormone IGF-1 in our bodies by stimulating its production in the liver. Increased IGF-1 levels are linked to cancers of the bowel, breast, and prostate. It may also transform pre-existing or benign tumours into a more aggressive form of cancer.","41":"Professor T. Colin Campbell, Jacob Gould Schurman Professor Emeritus of Nutritional Biochemistry at Cornell University, says that IGF-1 may turn out to be a predictor of certain cancers in the same way that cholesterol is a predictor of heart disease. A study from the\u00a0British Journal of Cancer\u00a0found that vegan men had a 9% lower IGF-1 level than vegetarians and meat-eaters.","42":"Bowel cancer is the second most common cancer in England and the third most common cause of cancer death. Several lifestyle factors have been linked to it: a Western diet, physical inactivity, obesity, and type 2 diabetes. The links between diet, weight, and exercise and bowel cancer are some of the strongest for any type of cancer, and raised IGF-1 levels are implicated.","43":"Eating cheese, butter, cream, ice cream, and other dairy foods not only increases IGF-1 levels but also increases the risk of becoming overweight and developing diabetes, which increases the risk of bowel cancer. Dairy foods offer no benefits to good bowel health while whole food, plant-based diets containing plenty of fruit and vegetables (and therefore fibre) and low in saturated fat reduce the risk of bowel cancer.","44":"Crohn's is linked to dairy foods via the MAP bacterium that causes Johne\u2019s disease in cattle. MAP infection is widespread among cattle and is found in commercial milk. Infection may occur from inhaling MAP in fine water spray from rivers contaminated with infected cow manure.","45":"This could explain the clusters of Crohn's that occur around cities with rivers such as Cardiff in Wales and Winnipeg in Minnesota, US. Professor John Hermon-Taylor at St George's Hospital Medical School in London has found MAP in patients with Crohn\u2019s disease from the UK, Ireland, US, Germany and United Arab Emirates. Avoiding dairy may not ensure avoiding MAP exposure \u2013 although if there were fewer cattle there would be less MAP in the environment.","46":"Breast cancer rates in the UK have risen steeply since the 1970s; the lifetime risk is now one in eight. Only five to 10 percent of breast cancer cases are caused by genes, most cases are caused by environmental factors. Research from Harvard School of Public Health suggests that nearly a third of all breast cancer deaths in high-income countries are caused by preventable lifestyle factors; alcohol, overweight\/obesity, lack of exercise.","47":"Women with breast cancer tend to have higher oestrogen levels and a typically meaty and dairy-rich Western-style diet increases the levels of these hormones. In fact, milk and dairy products are the main source of oestrogens in our diet.","48":"Changing diet could prevent or limit the progression of the disease as high-fiber, low-fat, vegan diets may lower hormone levels. Soya foods can also reduce breast cancer risk and improve the prognosis for women with the disease. A dairy-free plant-based diet can reduce the risk factors associated with breast cancer and may help those who have been diagnosed with the disease.","49":"The lifetime risk of prostate cancer for men in the UK is also one in eight. Just 5 to 15% of prostate cancers are linked to genes. So, like breast cancer, the majority of cases are caused by environmental and\/or lifestyle factors.","50":"Obesity and lack of exercise increases the risk. Rates are higher in countries consuming a typical Western diet. Men who eat lots of saturated animal fats (red meat such as beef, lamb and pork, eggs and butter, whole milk, cheese and cream) have an increased risk of getting the disease. Diets high in calcium and dairy protein may also increase the risk of prostate cancer.","51":"Cow's milk protein increases IGF-1 levels, a known risk factor for prostate cancer. It has also been suggested that regular exposure to oestrogen in milk from pregnant cows may explain the increased risk of prostate cancer in Western societies. On the positive side, a plant-based diet may slow prostate cancer progression and improve prognosis. In addition, specific plant foods, including flaxseeds (linseed), lycopene-rich tomatoes and soya foods may help reduce the risk, along with a high level of physical activity. Organic tomato ketchup may contain up to three times as much lycopene as non-organic.","52":"The World Health Organisation links heart disease to poor diets high in saturated fats, salt and refined carbohydrates and low in fruit and vegetables. Foods high in saturated fat include: meat pies, sausages and fatty cuts of meat, butter, ghee, lard, cream, hard cheese, cakes and biscuits and foods containing coconut or palm oil. Replacing unhealthy saturated fat with healthier polyunsaturated fat may be more effective in lowering the risk of heart disease than reducing the total amount of fat in the diet. Soya protein, nuts, plant sterols and soluble fibres (found in oats and some fruit, vegetables and pulses) can all help lower cholesterol, which is a risk factor for heart disease.","53":"Vegans have lower cholesterol, lower blood pressure and a lower risk of heart disease and stroke. British vegetarians have a whopping 32 percent lower risk of hospitalization or death from heart disease than meat-eaters. Cutting out the dairy component can only help!","54":"Early exposure to cow's milk proteins has been linked to type 1 diabetes. It is thought that certain proteins found in cow's milk may trigger an autoimmune reaction whereby our own immune cells attack these foreign dairy proteins, inadvertently destroying our insulin-producing pancreatic cells, thus leading to diabetes.","55":"Type 2 diabetes is occurring in younger and younger adults at the level of a global epidemic, driven by the increasing burden of obesity. If the trend continues, by 2035 the NHS could be spending nearly a fifth of its entire budget on diabetes alone.","56":"Caused by obesity, poor diet and lack of exercise \u2013 this disease is preventable and reversible. One obvious solution is to cut down on meat and dairy and increase fiber-rich fruit, vegetables, whole grains, pulses, nuts and seeds. Vegan diets offer huge benefits for diabetes management, including weight loss and improving blood lipid profile and glycaemic control. Indeed, low-fat vegan diets have been shown to reverse type 2 diabetes.","57":"In 1836, after returning from the Beagle, Charles Darwin wrote: \"I have had a bad spell. Vomiting every day for 11 days, and some days after every meal.\" For over 40 years, Darwin suffered from long bouts of vomiting, stomach cramps, headaches, severe tiredness, skin problems and depression.","58":"Researchers now suggest that he suffered from lactose intolerance. His case is a good example of how easily lactose intolerance can be missed. The ability to digest lactose (the sugar in milk) evolved as a result of a genetic mutation among some people in central Europe around 7,500 years ago.","59":"Descendants of these people are able to drink cow's milk today without suffering the symptoms of lactose intolerance (bloating, wind, discomfort etc). However, that doesn't mean it is good for them. Being lactose intolerant is the natural, normal state for most adults in the world.","60":"Lactose intolerance should not be confused with cow's milk allergy \u2013 they are entirely different. Cow's milk allergy is where the immune system reacts to proteins found in the milk wheras lactose intolerance is when the body cannot digest lactose \u2013 the sugar in milk.","61":"Those countries which consume the most dairy foods and animal protein have the highest hip fracture rates \u2013 dairy products don't protect our bones. Despite what the dairy industry says, cow's milk is not the best source of calcium and your bone health would benefit enormously by switching to plant-based sources.","62":"In a study published in the\u00a0British Medical Journal, it was suggested that it is time we revised our calcium recommendations for young people and changed our assumptions about the role of calcium, milk and other dairy products play in the bone health of children and adolescents. Physical (especially weight-bearing) exercise is the most critical factor for maintaining healthy bones, followed by improving the diet and lifestyle.","63":"Raising animals for food requires massive amounts of land, food, energy, and water and causes immense animal suffering.","64":"Globally, animal agriculture is responsible for more greenhouse gases than all the world\u2019s transportation systems combined. According to the United Nations, a global shift toward a vegan diet is necessary to combat the worst effects of\u00a0climate change.","65":"It takes an enormous amount of water to grow crops for animals to eat, clean filthy factory farms, and give animals water to drink. A single cow used for milk can drink up to 50 gallons of water per day\u2014or twice that amount in hot weather\u2014and it takes 683 gallons of water to produce just 1 gallon of milk. It takes more than 2,400 gallons of water to produce 1 pound of beef, while producing 1 pound of tofu only requires 244 gallons of water. By going vegan, one person can save approximately 219,000 gallons of water a year.","66":"Animals raised for food in the U.S. produce many times more excrement than does the entire human population of the country. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), animals on U.S. factory farms produce about 500 million tons of manure each year. With no animal sewage processing plants, it is most often stored in waste \u201clagoons\u201d (which can be seen in aerial views of factory farms) or it gets sprayed over fields.","67":"Runoff from factory farms and livestock grazing is one of the leading causes of pollution in our rivers and lakes. The EPA notes that bacteria and viruses can be carried by the runoff and that groundwater can be contaminated.","68":"Factory farms frequently dodge water pollution limits by spraying liquid manure into the air, creating mists that are carried away by the wind. People who live nearby are forced to inhale the toxins and pathogens from the sprayed manure. A report by the California State Senate noted, \u201cStudies have shown that [animal waste] lagoons emit toxic airborne chemicals that can cause inflammatory, immune, irritation and neurochemical problems in humans.\u201d","69":"Using land to grow crops for animals is vastly inefficient. It takes almost 20 times less land to feed someone on a plant-based (vegan) diet than it does to feed a meat-eater since the crops are consumed directly instead of being used to feed animals. According to the U.N. Convention to Combat Desertification, it takes up to 10 pounds of grain to produce just 1 pound of meat, and in the United States alone, 56 million acres of land are used to grow feed for animals, while only 4 million acres are producing plants for humans to eat.","70":"More than 90 percent of all Amazon rainforest land cleared since 1970 is used for grazing livestock. In addition, one of the main crops grown in the rainforest is soybeans used for animal feed. (The soybeans used in most veggie burger, tofu, and soy milk products sold in the United States are also grown in the U.S.)","71":"While factory farms are ruining our land, commercial fishing methods such as bottom trawling and long-lining often clear the ocean floor of all life and destroy coral reefs. They also kill thousands of dolphins, sea turtles, sharks, and other \u201cbycatch\u201d animals. Coastal fish farms release feces, antibiotics, parasites, and non-native fish into sensitive marine ecosystems. In addition, since most farmed fish are carnivorous, they are fed massive quantities of wild-caught fish. For example, it takes up to 3 pounds of fish meal to produce every pound of farmed salmon.","72":"Written by PETA, find the original article by clicking here.","73":"Plant milks have been consumed for centuries in various cultures, but their popularity has skyrocketed over the past decade. People choose plant milks over dairy milk for a variety of reasons. Whether it is for their nutritional value, animal welfare reasons, lower environmental impact, to avoid lactose or dairy milk allergens, or simply out of preference, there are many great options to try. ProVeg presents the 10 best non-dairy milk alternatives.","74":"More and more consumers are questioning the consumption of cow\u2019s milk and the effects that our diets have on cows, the environment, and our health. This is also reflected in the increasing demand for non-dairy milk. Plant milks have been consumed for centuries in various cultures, but their popularity has skyrocketed over the past decade. The range of healthy vegan milk alternatives for drinking, cooking, and baking is huge. Some vegan milk alternatives have sugar added to them, but unsweetened options are also available.","75":"Nutritionally, almond milk is quite different to soya or dairy milk. It has fewer calories and much less protein. The small amount of fat in almond milk is healthy unsaturated fat. Home-made almond milk can be a rich source of calcium, depending on the quantity of almonds used \u2013 it contains powerful antioxidants that can have a protective effect against cancer and heart disease. It has a mild and slightly nutty taste and is ideal for eating with cereals. Almond milk is less suitable for use in coffee as it has a flaky consistency.","76":"Oat milk is slightly sweet, with a thin consistency similar to low-fat milk. It contains a moderate amount of calories and has more protein than most plant-based milks. It also has more fibre than other milks, which is important because it helps regulate digestion and can lower cholesterol. Oat milk has more carbohydrates and sugar than many other milks \u2013 even unsweetened \u2013 so it may not be the best choice for people with diabetes. It is suitable for cooking and baking.","77":"Cashew milk has a slightly nutty taste and is suitable for cooking and baking. The fat contained is mostly heart-healthy unsaturated fat and can be a great choice for people with diabetes who need to watch their carbohydrate intake. Cashew milk has only about 2 grams of carbohydrates per cup. It is suitable for coffee and adds a thickness that works wonderfully in lattes.","78":"Coconut milk for cooking is usually available in cans. It is ideal for cooking and baking, giving food a delicious aroma. Coconut milk is delicious in all kinds of recipes \u2013 from curries to vegetable soups, smoothies, chia seed pudding and even ice cream. The thin coconut milk for drinking that comes in a carton is fantastic in a cup of coffee or in cereals.","79":"Hazelnut milk is an amazing plant-based alternative to dairy milk. Neither as common or popular as almond, hazelnut milk possesses several health-boosting properties. Hazelnuts are also an excellent source of the antioxidant vitamin E which promotes healthy hair and skin, as well as boosting the health of the heart muscles. It is rich in plant-based omega-3 fatty acid ALA, which has been proven to help keep cholesterol and blood pressure in check. It's also very versatile can be used just as dairy milk in cooking or drunk plain or with cereal or a hot beverage.","80":"Hemp milk is made from the seeds of the hemp plant. It is low in carbohydrates and high in fat \u2013 but most of those are healthy unsaturated fats. Just one glass of hemp milk can provide 50% of the recommended daily intake of alpha-linolenic acid, the omega-3 fatty acid, which helps support good heart and brain function. It is suitable for cooking and baking and has a slightly nutty taste.","81":"Macadamia milk arrived on the scene much more recently than the other nut milks mentioned here and is still not widely available. This nut milk is low in calories but also very low in both protein and carbohydrates. It tastes great on its own and is particularly suitable for desserts and coffee.","82":"Rice milk is less likely to cause food allergies compared to any other milk because it is nut and gluten-free. It has a naturally sweet taste and can be used for cooking and baking. Rice milk is extremely low in calories, which are mostly from carbohydrates, and it has very little protein or fat. Since rice milk is a rather thin milk, it is less suitable for coffee.","83":"Of the non-dairy milks, soya milk is the most nutritionally similar to cow\u2019s milk and is the most popular milk alternative so far. It is moderate in calories and is a good source of protein and calcium.\u00a0Soya milk contains compounds called isoflavones and phytosterols, that can possibly lower the risk of cancer, cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis.\u00a0It is suitable for a wide range of purposes and can be used without restriction for cooking, baking, or in coffee, and it can even be foamed. As with cow\u2019s milk, soya milk is now available in various flavours, such as vanilla, chocolate, or banana.","84":"Spelt milk is moderate in calories and low in protein. As a relative of wheat, it does contain gluten, so it is not suitable for anyone with celiac disease or gluten intolerance. Since spelt milk has a relatively sweet taste, even without added sugar, it is particularly suitable for sweet dishes and can be used as a natural sweetener, for example, in coffee.","85":" Written by ProVeg.com, find the original article by clicking here!","86":"","87":"People often drink cow's milk for calcium. Using the graph above you'll see that all plant-based milks are a comparable source of calcium. For protein, soy milk is a comparable source, while other plant-based milks contain comparatively little protein. If you want to drink milk for its protein content, choose soy. Also take note that everything on this list has a plant-based source. Protein can be found in tofu, beans, tempeh, seitan, and more. Calcium can be found in leafy green vegetables, nuts, and tofu. Yellow, red and green vegetables, as well as fruit, have vitamin A. Rice contains vitamin B2. Folate is found in broccoli, brussels sprouts, peas, and chickpeas. Vitamin E is found in nuts and seeds. ","88":"","89":"Numerous scientific studies show that the greenhouse gas emissions used in the production of plant-based milks are far lower than for dairy milk.","90":"Looking at the global averages illustrated in the chart below, producing a glass of dairy milk results in almost three times the greenhouse gas emissions of any non-dairy milks,\u00a0according to a University of Oxford study. Looking at land use, the difference is starker still. ","91":"Producing a glass of dairy milk every day for a year requires 650 sq m (7,000 sq ft) of land, the equivalent of two tennis courts and more than 10 times as much as the same amount of oat milk, according to this study.","92":"Almond milk requires more water to produce than soy or oat milk. A single glass requires 74 litres (130 pints of water) - more than a typical shower. Rice milk is also comparatively thirsty, requiring 54 litres of water per glass. However, it's worth noting that both almond and rice milk still require less water to produce than the typical glass of dairy milk.","93":"People tend to underestimate the greenhouse gas emissions from food, and dairy milk is no exception, according to research by Dr Adrian Camilleri, a psychologist at the University of Technology Sydney. \"The greenhouse gas emissions from milk are about 30 times higher than what people estimate,\" he told BBC News. \"I suspect that most consumers underestimate the greenhouse gas emissions saved by switching from dairy milk to plant-based milk such as soy milk.\" (source)","94":"However, this information spurs more questions when it comes to sustainability. What about the deforestation due to soy? When worrying about deforestation, soy for human consumption is not the culprit. Only 6% of soybeans are grown for human consumption, while 70% are used to feed livestock. The WWF reports that 80% of the deforestation in the Amazon is due to cattle ranching. If you want to stand against deforestation, instead of boycotting soy, boycott meat and dairy.","95":"Find more cute videos and gif's of happy cows by clicking here!","96":"Learn more about Erin Janus
